<p1>
<h2>How many days a lion can live without eating?</h2>
Cubs will start chewing on meat at about <em2>6 - 8 weeks</em2> old, when their teeth are <br>
starting to develop. How long can they go without eating or drinking? They can go <br>
without food for a maximum of 14 days and without water for<em2> 4 days</em2> but will eat wild <br>
cucumbers and wild melons to extract the moisture content.<br><br>

<h3>What kind of animal eats a lion?</h3>
Lions have almost no predators. However, old, sick lions are sometimes attacked, killed and eaten by hyenas. <br>
And very young lions can be killed by hyenas, leopards and other predators when they are not being watched carefully <br>
by their mothers. But a healthy adult lion has little to fear from any other animal.<br>

<h2>Do lions eat other Lions?</h2>
There have been cases where lions are seen eating dead cubs after killing them even <br>
killing other lions as well. GROSS: Later in the film, we see lions preying on buffalo <br>
because the lions need food, and they can eat the buffalo. ... Ms. JOUBERT: <em2>No, the lion <br>
will not eat another lion</em2>.<br><br>

<h3>How long does it take a lion to starve to death?</h3>
Provided it is well-fed to start with, a lion can go several weeks <br>
without food. It will start to lose condition after about two weeks, <br>
but it can survive for longer and some lions have been known to go a <br>
month without food.<br><br>

<h2>What is a lion afraid of?</h2>
Lions (male and female) are afraid of large mammals like giraffes, <br>
hippos and elephants, but they are also afraid of their day-to-day prey.<br><br>

<h3>Can a zebra kill a lion?</h3>
A cornered zebra rears, kicks and bites in defense. There have been numerous recorded cases of zebras <br>\
killing lions, generally by a swift kick to the head that at the very least breaks the jaw, resulting <br>
in the cat's eventual starvation. ... It's not a docile creature that survives the plains of Africa <br>
and can kill a lion.<br>

<h2>What animal can kill a lion?</h2>
The other predators such as the leopard, cheetah and hyenas are no match for the strong lion who can kill <br>
a hyena with a bow of its paw. So the lion really does not have many predators although it is hunted in <br>
some occasions: <em2>young cubs can be hunted by other predators if left alone</em2>.<br><br>
